# Pegasus Chess Engine
Chess engine built from the ground up in C++. Follows the Universal Chess Interface (UCI).

This project has been abandoned due to a lack of interest from team members. If interest is regained, or a new team wishes to take this code, let me know (jose01carrillo30@gmail.com or anywhere else I can be reached) and we can discuss arrangements.

## Contribution
We are not looking for outside help at this time.

## Standards
Board is indexed so that the BOTTOM LEFT CORNER is index 0 (for both 120 and 64 index)
